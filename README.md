about the technologies and workflow: * **Programming Language:** Python. * **Libraries/Frameworks:** * TensorFlow: Used for building and training the flower recognition model. * Streamlit: Used to create the web app for image uploading and classification. * NumPy: Used for numerical operations, especially in calculating the prediction scores. * **Model:** The model is likely a Keras model (`Flower_Recog_Model.keras`), given the use of TensorFlow and the `.keras` extension. * 
**Workflow:** 1. The user uploads an image through the Streamlit web app. 2. The image is preprocessed and fed into the flower recognition model. 3. The model predicts the flower type. 4. The predicted flower name and confidence score are displayed in the Streamlit app. 
* **Execution:** The Streamlit app is run using the command `streamlit run app.py`,
